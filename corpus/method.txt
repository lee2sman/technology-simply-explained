left-align everything:
:%left<CR>

remove blank lines:
:g/^$/d

concat all lines

1800J

(i think that's how many lines of the file there were)

now make all lines end at period:

:%s/\./.\r/g

remove lines that do not start with letters:

:g!/^[a-zA-Z]/d

Use shuf to scramble:

shuf input.txt > output.txt
